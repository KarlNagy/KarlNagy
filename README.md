- 👋 Hi, I’m @KarlNagy
- 👀 I play dungeons and dragons and hang out with family when not coding.
- 🌱 I just finished the Data Analytics certificate from google on coursera. Spreadsheets, SQL, R, visualizations, and structured analysis thinking! Cool stuff!
- 💞️ I’m looking for a mentor to help walk me through the beginnings of my new career in Data Analytics, advice would be appreciated.
